# Murmurations is a distributed data sharing protocol to facilitate collaboration at scale.

[READ THE WHITE PAPER](https://docs.murmurations.network/Murmurations-White-Paper-v1.0.pdf)

## How it works

The Murmurations protocol combines three key elements.

1

#### Profiles

A Murmurations profile is a .json file which describes a ‘node’ on the Murmurations network.

Anyone can make a profile to describe a person, a project, an organisation, or any other entity.

Profiles are hosted anywhere online and their URLs are submitted to the Murmurations Network.

2

#### The Network

The Murmurations Network of indexes keeps a record of all the profile URLs and timestamps of when they were last updated.

When you update a profile you can resubmit its URL to update an index in the network.

Indexes are accessible to aggregators via [an open API](https://docs.murmurations.network/developers/index-api.html).

#### Aggregators

Aggregators query the indexes regularly for profile changes, enabling them to provide accurate and timely information in maps, directories and content aggregators, using the [Murmurations WordPress aggregator plugin](https://docs.murmurations.network/developers/wp-aggregator.html#overview), or their own custom code.

Murmurations also enables other types of decentralised data sharing and content aggregation – read about [what else you can build on Murmurations](https://murmurations.network/2024/06/04/what-can-you-build-on-the-murmurations-protocol-2/).

## What can you do with Murmurations?

# Collaborative Mapping

## Murmurations enables multiple maps and directories to be built from a shared, distributed data set.

Murmurations solves the problems of centralised maps and directories, managed by a single entity or person by:

- Distributing the effort of data collection
- Making data interoperable so it can power multiple maps and directories
- Providing a ‘last updated’ timestamp to show the age of every profile
- Distributing the effort of keeping data up to date
- Enabling Profile changes to be reflected on multiple maps and directories
- Improving data quality, reliability and usability
