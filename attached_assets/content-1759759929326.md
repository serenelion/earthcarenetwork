# Testing

## Simulate payments to test your integration.

Ask about this page

Copy for LLM

View as Markdown

To test your integration, simulate transactions without moving any money using special testing values in a [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes). You can access your sandboxes using the account picker at the top right of the page or in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sandboxes).

Test cards act as fake credit cards, and allow you to simulate the following scenarios:

- Successful payments by [card brand](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards) or [country](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#international-cards)
- Card errors due to [declines](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#declined-payments), [fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#fraud-prevention), or [invalid data](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#invalid-data)
- [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#disputes) and [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#refunds)
- Authentication with [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#regulatory-cards) and [PINs](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#terminal)

Testing non-card payments works similarly. Non-card payments are payment methods that aren’t credit or debit cards. Stripe supports various non-card payment options, such as digital wallets and bank transfers. [Each payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#non-card-payments) has its own special values.

Don’t use testing environments to load test your integration because you might hit [rate limits](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#rate-limits). To load test your integration, see [load testing](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits#load-testing).

## How to use test cards ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Any time you work with a test card, use [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) in all API calls. This is true whether you’re serving a payment form to test interactively or writing test code.

#### Common mistake

Don’t use real card details. The [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa#1-your-stripe-account) prohibits testing in live mode using real payment method details. Use your test API keys and the card numbers below.

### Testing interactively![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

When testing interactively, use a card number, such as [4242 4242 4242 4242](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=card-numbers#visa). Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.

- Use a valid future date, such as **12/34**.
- Use any three-digit CVC (four digits for American Express cards).
- Use any value you like for other form fields.

![An example payment form showing how to enter a test card number. The card number is "4242 4242 4242 4242", the expiration date is "12/34", and the CVC is "567". Other fields have arbitrary values. For instance, the email address is "test@example.com"](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-card.c3f9b3d1a3e8caca3c9f4c9c481fd49c.jpg)

Testing a form interactively with the test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242

### Test code![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

When writing test code, use a `PaymentMethod` such as [pm\_card\_visa](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=payment-methods#visa) instead of a card number. We don’t recommend using card numbers directly in API calls or server-side code, even in testing environments. If you do use them, your code might not be PCI-compliant when you go live. By default, a `PaymentMethod` isn’t attached to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).

Most integrations don’t use Tokens anymore, but we make test Tokens such as [tok\_visa](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=tokens#visa) available if you need them.

When you’re ready to take your integration live, replace your test publishable and secret [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) with live ones. You can’t process live payments if your integration is still using your test API keys.

## Cards by brand ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To simulate a successful payment for a specific card brand, use test cards from the following list.

#### Caution

Cross-border fees are assessed based on the country of the card issuer. Cards where the issuer country isn’t the US (such as JCB and UnionPay) might be subject to a cross-border fee, even in testing environments.

## HSA and FSA test cards ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Below are test card numbers for simulating transactions using Health Savings Accounts (HSA) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA). These accounts are commonly used for medical expenses, and testing with them ensures proper handling of healthcare-related transactions within your application.

Card numbers

PaymentMethods

| Brand/Type | Number | CVC | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visa FSA | 4000051230000072 | Any 3 digits | Any future date |
| Visa HSA | 4000051230000072 | Any 3 digits | Any future date |
| Mastercard FSA | 5200828282828897 | Any 3 digits | Any future date |

## Declined payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To test your integration’s error-handling logic by simulating payments that the issuer declines for various reasons, use test cards from this section. Using one of these cards results in a [card error](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling#payment-errors) with the given [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes) and [decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes).

#### Common mistake

To simulate an incorrect CVC, you must provide one using any three-digit number. If you don’t provide a CVC, Stripe doesn’t perform the CVC check, so the check can’t fail.

Card numbers

The cards in the previous table can’t be attached to a Customer object. To simulate a declined payment with a successfully attached card, use the next one.

| Description | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decline after attaching | 4000000000000341 | Attaching this card to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object succeeds, but attempts to charge the customer fail. |

## Fraud prevention![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Stripe’s fraud prevention system, Radar, can block payments when they have a high risk level or fail verification checks. You can use the cards in this section to test your Radar settings. You can also use them to test how your integration responds to blocked payments.

Each card simulates specific risk factors. Your Radar settings determine which risk factors cause it to block a payment. Blocked payments result in [card errors with an error code of fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling).

#### Common mistake

To simulate a failed CVC check, you must provide a CVC using any three-digit number. To simulate a failed postal code check, you must provide any valid postal code. If you don’t provide those values, Radar doesn’t perform the corresponding checks, so the checks can’t fail.

## Invalid data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To test errors resulting from invalid data, provide invalid details. You don’t need a special test card for this. Any invalid value works. For instance:

- [invalid\_expiry\_month](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes#invalid_expiry_month): Use an invalid month, such as **13**.
- [invalid\_expiry\_year](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes#invalid_expiry_year): Use a year up to 50 years in the past, such as **95**.
- [invalid\_cvc](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes#invalid_cvc): Use a two-digit number, such as **99**.
- [incorrect\_number](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes#incorrect_number): Use a card number that fails the [Luhn check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm), such as 4242424242424241

To simulate a [disputed transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes), use the test cards in this section. Then, to simulate winning or losing the dispute, provide [winning or losing evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#evidence).

Card numbers

PaymentMethods

Tokens

| Description | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fraudulent | 4000000000000259 | With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed as [fraudulent](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories). This type of dispute is [protected](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments) after 3D Secure authentication. |
| Not received | 4000000000002685 | With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed as [product not received](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories). This type of dispute [isn’t protected](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments) after 3D Secure authentication. |
| Inquiry | 4000000000001976 | With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed as [an inquiry](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#inquiries). |
| Warning | 4000000000005423 | With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to receive [an early fraud warning](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings). |
| Multiple disputes | 4000000404000079 | With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed [multiple times](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#multiple-disputes). |
| Visa Compelling Evidence 3.0 | 4000000404000038 | With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed as a [Visa Compelling Evidence 3.0 eligible dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api/visa-ce3#testing). |
| Visa compliance | 4000008400000779 | With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed as a [Visa compliance dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api/visa-compliance#testing). |

### Evidence ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To simulate winning or losing the dispute, respond with one of the evidence values from the table below.

- If you [respond using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api), pass the value from the table as [uncategorized\_text](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/update#update_dispute-evidence-uncategorized_text).
- If you [respond in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding) or in [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/disputes-list), enter the value from the table in the **Additional information** field. Then, click **Submit evidence**.

| Evidence | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `winning_evidence` | Closes the dispute as won and credits your account for the amount of the charge and related fees. |
| `losing_evidence` | Closes the dispute as lost without crediting your account. For inquiries, this closes the inquiry without escalation. |
| `escalate_inquiry_evidence` | Escalates the inquiry to a chargeback. This transitions the inquiry to a full dispute and debits your account for the amount of the dispute and related fees. |

## Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

In live mode, refunds are asynchronous: a refund can appear to succeed and later fail, or can appear as `pending` at first and later succeed. To simulate refunds with those behaviors, use the test cards in this section. (With all other test cards, refunds succeed immediately and don’t change status after that.)

Card numbers

PaymentMethods

Tokens

| Description | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Asynchronous success | 4000000000007726 | The charge succeeds. If you initiate a refund, its status begins as `pending`. Some timelater, its status transitions to `succeeded` and sends a `refund.updated` [event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.updated). |
| Asynchronous failure | 4000000000005126 | The charge succeeds. If you initiate a refund, its status begins as `succeeded`. Some timelater, its status transitions to `failed` and sends a `refund.failed` [event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.failed). |

You can cancel a card refund only by using the Dashboard. In live mode, you can cancel a card refund within a short but nonspecific period of time. Testing environments simulate that period by allowing you to cancel a card refund within 30 minutes.

## Available balance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To send the funds from a test transaction directly to your available balance, use the test cards in this section. Other test cards send funds from a successful payment to your pending balance.

Card numbers

PaymentMethods

Tokens

| Description | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bypass pending balance | 4000000000000077 | The US charge succeeds. Funds are added directly to your available balance, bypassing your pending balance. |
| Bypass pending balance | 4000003720000278 | The international charge succeeds. Funds are added directly to your available balance, bypassing your pending balance. |

## 3D Secure authentication ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

3D Secure requires an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions. The test cards in this section allow you to simulate triggering authentication in different payment flows.

Only cards in this section effectively test your 3D Secure integration by simulating defined 3DS behavior, such as a challenge flow or an unsupported card. Other Stripe testing cards might still trigger 3DS, but we return `attempt_acknowledged` to bypass the additional steps since 3DS testing isn’t the objective for those cards.

#### Dashboard not supported

3D Secure redirects won’t occur for payments created directly in the Stripe Dashboard. Instead, use your integration’s own frontend or an API call.

### Authentication and setup![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To simulate payment flows that include authentication, use the test cards in this section. Some of these cards can also be [set up](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) for future payments, or have already been.

Card numbers

PaymentMethods

| Description | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |
| --- |
| Authenticate unless set up | 4000002500003155 | This card requires authentication for off-session payments unless you [set it up](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) for future payments. After you set it up, off-session payments no longer require authentication. However, on-session payments with this card always require authentication. |
| Always authenticate | 4000002760003184 | This card requires authentication on all transactions, regardless of how the card is set up. |
| Already set up | 4000003800000446 | This card is already set up for off-session use. It requires authentication for [one-time](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web) and other [on-session](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment#web-submit-payment) payments. However, all off-session payments succeed as if the card has been previously [set up](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse). |
| Insufficient funds | 4000008260003178 | This card requires authentication for [one-time payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web). All payments are declined with an `insufficient_funds` failure code even after being successfully authenticated or previously [set up](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse). |

### Support and availability ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Stripe requests authentication when required by regulation or when triggered by your Radar rules or custom code. Even if authentication is requested, it can’t always be performed—for instance, the customer’s card might not be enrolled, or an error might occur. Use the test cards in this section to simulate various combinations of these factors.

#### Note

All 3DS references indicate [3D Secure 2](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2).

Card numbers

| 3DS Not supported | 378282246310005 | 3D Secure isn’t supported on this card and can’t be invoked.The PaymentIntent or SetupIntent proceeds without performing authentication. |

### 3D Secure mobile challenge flows![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

In a mobile payment, several challenge flows for authentication—where the customer has to interact with prompts in the UI—are available. Use the test cards in this section to trigger a specific challenge flow for test purposes. These cards aren’t useful in browser-based payment forms or in API calls. In those environments, they work but don’t trigger any special behavior. Because they’re not useful in API calls, we don’t provide any `PaymentMethod` or `Token` values to test with.

| Challenge flow | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |
| --- |
| Out of band | 4000582600000094 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with Out of Band UI. |
| One time passcode | 4000582600000045 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with One Time Passcode UI. |
| Single select | 4000582600000102 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with single-select UI. |
| Multi select | 4000582600000110 | 3D Secure 2 authentication must be completed on all transactions. Triggers the challenge flow with multi-select UI. |

## Captcha challenge ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To prevent fraud, Stripe might display a captcha challenge to the user on the payment page. Use the test cards below to simulate this flow.

| Description | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Captcha challenge | 4000000000001208 | The charge succeeds if the user correctly answers the captcha challenge. |
| Captcha challenge | 4000000000003725 | The charge succeeds if the user correctly answers the captcha challenge. |

## Payments with PINs ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Use the test cards in this section to simulate successful in-person payments where a PIN is involved. There are many other options for testing in-person payments, including a simulated reader and physical test cards. See [Test Stripe Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing) for more information.

Card numbers

PaymentMethods

| Description | Number | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline PIN | 4001007020000002 | This card simulates a payment where the cardholder is prompted for and enters an offline PIN. The resulting charge has [cardholder\_verification\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-receipt-cardholder_verification_method) set to `offline_pin`. |
| Offline PIN retry | 4000008260000075 | Simulates an SCA-triggered retry flow where a cardholder’s initial contactless charge fails and the reader then prompts the user to insert their card and enter their offline PIN. The resulting charge has [cardholder\_verification\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-receipt-cardholder_verification_method) set to `offline_pin`. |
| Online PIN | 4001000360000005 | This card simulates a payment where the cardholder is prompted for and enters an online PIN. The resulting charge has [cardholder\_verification\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-receipt-cardholder_verification_method) set to `online_pin`. |
| Online PIN retry | 4000002760000008 | Simulates an SCA-triggered retry flow where a cardholder’s initial contactless charge fails and the reader then prompts the user to insert their card and enter their online PIN. The resulting charge has [cardholder\_verification\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-receipt-cardholder_verification_method) set to `online_pin`. |

## Event destinations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To test your webhook endpoint or [event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations), choose one of these two options:

1. Perform actions in a sandbox that send legitimate events to your event destination. For example, to trigger the [charge.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api#event_types-charge.succeeded) event, you can use a [test card that produces a successful charge](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards).
2. [Trigger events using the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook) or [using Stripe for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-vscode#webhooks).

## Rate limits![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

If your requests in your testing environments begin to receive `429` HTTP errors, make them less frequently. These errors come from our [rate limiter](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits), which is more strict in testing environments than in live mode.

We don’t recommend load testing your integration using the Stripe API in testing environments. Because the load limiter is stricter in testing environments, you might see errors that you wouldn’t see in production. See [load testing](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits#load-testing) for an alternative approach.

## Non-card payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Any time you use a test non-card payment method, use [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) in all API calls. This is true whether you’re serving a payment form you can test interactively or writing test code.

Different payment methods have different test procedures:

ACH Direct Debit

SEPA Direct Debit

BACS Direct Debit

AU BECS Direct Debit

Others

Learn how to test scenarios with instant verifications using [Financial Connections](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/testing#web-how-to-use-test-accounts).

### Send transaction emails in a sandbox![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

After you collect the bank account details and accept a mandate, send the mandate confirmation and microdeposit verification emails in a [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes).

If your domain is **{domain}** and your username is **{username}**, use the the following email format to send test transaction emails: **{username}+test\_email@{domain}**.

For example, if your domain is **example.com** and your username is **info**, use the format **info+test\_email@example.com** for testing ACH Direct Debit payments. This format ensures that emails route correctly. If you don’t include the **+test\_email** suffix, we won’t send the email.

#### Common mistake

You need to [activate your Stripe account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate) before you can trigger these emails while testing.

### Test account numbers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Stripe provides several test account numbers and corresponding tokens you can use to make sure your integration for manually-entered bank accounts is ready for production.

| Account number | Token | Routing number | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `000123456789` | `pm_usBankAccount_success` | `110000000` | The payment succeeds. |
| `000111111113` | `pm_usBankAccount_accountClosed` | `110000000` | The payment fails because the account is closed. |
| `000000004954` | `pm_usBankAccount_riskLevelHighest` | `110000000` | The payment is blocked by Radar due to a [high risk of fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#high-risk). |
| `000111111116` | `pm_usBankAccount_noAccount` | `110000000` | The payment fails because no account is found. |
| `000222222227` | `pm_usBankAccount_insufficientFunds` | `110000000` | The payment fails due to insufficient funds. |
| `000333333335` | `pm_usBankAccount_debitNotAuthorized` | `110000000` | The payment fails because debits aren’t authorized. |
| `000444444440` | `pm_usBankAccount_invalidCurrency` | `110000000` | The payment fails due to invalid currency. |
| `000666666661` | `pm_usBankAccount_failMicrodeposits` | `110000000` | The payment fails to send microdeposits. |
| `000555555559` | `pm_usBankAccount_dispute` | `110000000` | The payment triggers a dispute. |
| `000000000009` | `pm_usBankAccount_processing` | `110000000` | The payment stays in processing indefinitely. Useful for testing [PaymentIntent cancellation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/cancel). |
| `000777777771` | `pm_usBankAccount_weeklyLimitExceeded` | `110000000` | The payment fails due to payment amount causing the account to exceed its weekly payment volume limit. |

Before test transactions can complete, you need to verify all test accounts that automatically succeed or fail the payment. To do so, use the test microdeposit amounts or descriptor codes below.

### Test microdeposit amounts and descriptor codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To mimic different scenarios, use these microdeposit amounts _or_ 0.01 descriptor code values.

| Microdeposit values | 0.01 descriptor code values | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `32` and `45` | SM11AA | Simulates verifying the account. |
| `10` and `11` | SM33CC | Simulates exceeding the number of allowed verification attempts. |
| `40` and `41` | SM44DD | Simulates a microdeposit timeout. |

### Test settlement behavior![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Test transactions settle instantly and are added to your available test balance. This behavior differs from livemode, where transactions can take [multiple days](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#timing) to settle in your available balance.

## Link![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

#### Caution

Don’t store real user data in [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) Link accounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test accounts are associated with your publishable key.

Currently, Link only works with credit cards, debit cards, and qualified US bank account purchases. Link requires [domain registration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration).

You can create sandbox accounts for Link using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating sandbox accounts:

| Value | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Any other 6 digits not listed below | Success |
| 000001 | Error, code invalid |
| 000002 | Error, code expired |
| 000003 | Error, max attempts exceeded |

### Multiple funding sources![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

As Stripe adds additional funding source support, you don’t need to update your integration. Stripe automatically supports them with the same transaction settlement time and guarantees as card and bank account payments.

## Redirects![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To test your integration’s redirect-handling logic by simulating a payment that uses a redirect flow (for example, iDEAL), use a supported payment method that [requires redirects](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#additional-api-supportability).

To create a test `PaymentIntent` that either succeeds or fails:

1. Navigate to the [payment methods settings in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable a supported payment method by clicking **Turn on** in your testing environment.
2. Collect payment details.
3. Submit the payment to Stripe.
4. Authorize or fail the test payment.

Make sure that the page (corresponding to `return_url`) on your website provides the status of the payment.
