LEICHT Curves Edition

Curved side panels in matte lacquer sweep around the island, softening transitions between prep, seating, and living zones.

All-round curved planning

### Curved side panels that shape the room

Within the TerraLux concept, LEICHT’s new rounded side panels create a flowing bridge between kitchen and living space. Matching worktop radii and concealed technology keep the horizon serene while generous storage and utilities remain discreetly integrated.

- Continuous arcs invite guests to circulate naturally, maintaining conversation from entry to seating.
- Available across the full matte lacquer palette and select LEICHT woods, curves carry color and texture without visible seams.
- Coordinated worktop radii and concealed services deliver expressive design with the warmth of a lived-in space.
