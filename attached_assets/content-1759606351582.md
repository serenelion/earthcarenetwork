Don't you miss the days when the web really was the world's greatest decentralized network? Before everything got locked down into a handful of walled gardens? So do we.

[![ActivityPub tutorial image](https://activitypub.rocks/static/images/ActivityPub-tutorial-image.png)](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview)

Enter [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)! ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol based on the [ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) data format. ActivityPub is an official W3C recommended standard published by the [W3C Social Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg). It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and subscribing to content.

Sounds exciting? Dive in!
