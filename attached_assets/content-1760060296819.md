#### Rock Steady Farm

Rock Steady Farm is a queer- and trans-led multiracial worker cooperative in Millerton, NY.

Our vision is for QTBIPOC farmers to thrive and experience abundant queer joy in rural spaces while everyone has access to culturally meaningful food and wealth and resources are shared equitably. We value respect and care for the natural world, equitable access to nourishing food, recognition of intersectional experiences, a relational culture of care and play, and inclusive learning that celebrates QTBIPOC wisdom. Through our work we grow vegetables, operate a CSA, and distribute the majority of our harvest to food access programs in the Hudson Valley and New York City, while providing affirming, land-based training so QTBIPOC farmers can thrive.

#### Silver Sands Motel

VISION:
To be the renaissance of the American motor lodge - where past meets present, creating a timeless waterfront retreat that honors the forgotten, the offbeat, and the iconic spirit of 1950s-60s Americana while embracing contemporary comfort and sustainability.

MISSION:
Silver Sands Motel is dedicated to reawakening the golden era of roadside hospitality through context-driven development that:
• Preserves and celebrates the authentic charm of mid-century motor lodge culture

• Interprets the emotions and ethos of the 1950s through a contemporary lens

2\. Sustainable Development: Implement context-driven development practices that consider history and sustainability in every detail - from furniture and service to color palette and gardens.

3\. Authentic Experience: Create an atmosphere that is nothing contrived, nothing unapproachable - offering genuine comfort, leisure, color, fun, and recreation reminiscent of the golden era.

4\. Environmental Harmony: Design meadow-like aesthetics deliberately connected to the land, with spaces that complement rather than compete with the natural beachfront setting.

5\. Cultural Revival: Join and lead the quiet movement of new generation moteliers who see charm in weathered wood and possibility in patina, making roadside Americana relevant for modern travelers.

6\. Sensory Engagement: Rekindle guests' senses through thoughtful design elements that evoke the vibrant ethos of mid-century America while providing modern comfort.

7\. Community Building: Foster a sense of nostalgia, identity, and heritage that connects guests to the broader narrative of American travel culture.

Our guiding principle: "Make a better future with elements recreated from the past" - Everything old is new again at Silver Sands Motel.

How might we allocate money and resources?
How might roles and authority be defined and evolve?
How might we approach scaling the structure as the movement grows?
What is needed to publicly launch our coalition, our story, and the pathways for others to plug in and collaborate? What is the permeability of our membrane - to attract what we want and to have layers in place that help us avoid letting in what we don’t want?
